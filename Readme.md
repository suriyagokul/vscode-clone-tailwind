# Visual Studio Code Clone Using Tailwind.

### what are different sections in the web site:

    - Navbar

    - Hero Section

    - Footer

### Challenges Faced:

    To make Page Responsive to Smaller Screens.

    Working with custom styles.

    Working with flexbox and grid.

```tailwind

    Just One line of CDN link is required to add tailwind to our website i.e

            <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

    Used assets are --->

            <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins' rel='stylesheet'>
            <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/0d5da3b07d.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

            Custom Font and Font Awesome for icons...

```

### Deployment Options

    _We have various ways to deploy our web application (hosting) easily in couple of mins_

        1) Netlify

        2) Vercel

        3) Heroku

    We can Integrate our git repository to those hosting sites or we can deploy manually to them...

### Advantage of using git

    We can easily maintain versions, roll backing to previous versions, pipelining...etc

    Whenever we update code and pushes to github the build runs automatically in above websites and deployed..
    we doesn't need to do anything.
